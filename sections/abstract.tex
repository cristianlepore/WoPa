Market centralization occurs in a variety of ways: aggregators (such as travel discounts), price comparison websites (such as energy contracts with commission-based pricing), online marketplaces (such as used-item sales), or auctions (e.g., concert tickets). The consumer market is mostly transparent to customers that lack of clarity on what happens with their data when they share it on a website. The \textit{General Data Protection Regulation} (GDPR) sets a milestone to protect EU citizen privacy with regards to data sharing. This paper discuses current challenges of the market competition law and proposes a privacy-enhancing framework based on legal and technology to increase users' privacy. A study case is presented to demonstrate the feasibility of our framework and draw conclusions.
