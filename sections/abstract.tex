Rather than the expected market flattening by digital advances, market centralization is being witnessed in many data-driven economic markets, such as aggregators, social media markets, e-commerce, and search engines. The control over personal data, at the intersection of personal privacy and commercial assets, shapes market competition to foster market dominance in subtle ways. To restore a fair distribution of power, the European data protection regulation sets data minimization as the general benchmark, but the legal and technical framework for achieving this target is left open. This work proposes a GDPR-compliant tool to improve effective market competition from legal and technical data minimization. We demonstrate the value of our proposal and draw conclusions on theoretical and practical analysis.
