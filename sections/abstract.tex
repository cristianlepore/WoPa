Market centralization occurs in many different data-driven economic markets, as aggregators, social media markets, E-commerce markets, or search engine markets. User data is not only an essential dimension of personal privacy protection but also an important influencing factor in market competition. The correlation between market power and the way to access user data is widely accepted and the expanding control of user data from the big technology companies is considered to create barriers to entry for market competition. This paper proposes a GDPR-compliant privacy-enhancing framework based on legal and technology as a potential means to improve the regulation from the data minimization principle. We use an empirical study to demonstrate the feasibility of our framework and draw conclusions based on realistic scenarios.
