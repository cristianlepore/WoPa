Market centralization occurs in many data-driven economic markets, such as aggregators, social media markets, e-commerce, and search engines. Data is an essential dimension of users' privacy and constitutes a value for the industry that exerts control over personal data leading to entry-level barriers to market competition. The European data protection regulation sets a milestone to restore a fair distribution of power but fails to provide technical means. This work proposes a GDPR-compliant tool based on legal and technology for data minimization that preserves market competition. We use an empirical study to demonstrate the value of our proposal and draw conclusions based on realistic scenarios.
