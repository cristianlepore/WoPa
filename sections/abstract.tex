Market centralization occurs in many data-driven economic markets, such as aggregators, social media markets, e-commerce, and search engines. Data is an essential dimension of users' privacy protection and a relevant factor in market competition. The correlation between market power and the way to access user data is widely accepted, as the expanding control of user data from big technology companies is considered an entry-level barrier to market competition. This paper proposes a GDPR-compliant privacy-enhancing framework based on legal and technology as a potential means to improve the regulation from the data minimization principle. We use an empirical study to demonstrate the feasibility of our framework and draw conclusions based on realistic scenarios.
