Market centralization occurs in many ways, such as aggregators, travel discounts, price comparison websites, online marketplaces, or auctions (e.g., concert tickets). The consumer market is mostly transparent to customers who lack clarity on what happens with their data when they share it on a website. The \textit{General Data Protection Regulation} (GDPR) aims to protect European citizen privacy concerning data sharing. This paper discusses the current challenges of the market competition law and proposes a GDPR-compliant privacy-enhancing framework based on legal and technology as a potential means to improve the regulation. We present a case study to demonstrate the feasibility of our framework and draw conclusions based on a real-case scenario.
