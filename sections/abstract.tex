Market centralization occurs in many data-driven economic markets, such as aggregators, social media markets, e-commerce, and search engines. Data is an essential dimension of users' privacy protection and a relevant factor in market competition. The correlation between market power and the way to access user data is widely accepted, as the expanding control of user data from big technology companies is considered an entry-level barrier to market competition. This paper proposes a GDPR-compliant privacy-respecting framework (tool) based on legal and technology as a potential means to follow regulation from the data minimization principle. We use an empirical study to demonstrate the feasibility of our framework and draw conclusions based on realistic scenarios.

design a GDPR compliant framework based on legal and technology for data minimization able to disrupt market competition

find a good way to achieve the principle described in the GDPR

follows the standard to achieve perfect data minimization
